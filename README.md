# Protein-Interaction-Network-Analysis
An R project for analyzing protein interactions 🧬 using bioinformatics tools and network analysis 🌐. Explores enzyme prediction 🔍, domain analysis 📊, and structural insights 🏗️

# Protein Interaction Network Analysis 🧬🔍

## Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of R scripts designed for the analysis of protein interactions, focusing on enzyme prediction, domain analysis, and structural insights. Utilizing `bio3d` and `igraph`, we process PDB files to explore the molecular structure and interaction networks of proteins.

## Getting Started 🚀
To run the analyses contained within this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- R programming environment
- Installed R packages: `bio3d`, `igraph`
  ### Usage
1. Set the project directory in the script to match your local setup.
2. Run the scripts to perform analysis on your protein data files.

## Features 🌟
- **Protein Domain Analysis:** Extracts and analyzes specific protein domains from PDB files.
- **Distance Matrix Calculation:** Computes distance matrices for all atoms and carbon alpha atoms.
- **Network Analysis:** Generates interaction networks based on distance thresholds.
- **Visualization:** Creates network plots to visualize protein interactions.

Happy Coding! 😊👩‍💻👨‍💻
